USEABILITY

Improve filepicker to point-and-click GUI.  # DONE
Process multiple essays.
Package for colleagues to use on MS Windows.

PROBLEMS

Still missing the first and last word of some quotations.

some words crash into eachother - check that this is not problem with the original essays being already corrected.

Failing one test_find_matches

References are highlighted (smaller problem)
  Solutions:
    1. Have a re.group within find_in_sa(), which compares with a regex from of a citation and rejects matches. This could also be used for bibliographies and runs like 'in the same' or 'it would seem that'. The senstivity/number of words could be checked here too.
    2. Strip sa of references and bibliography before making para_words list. This would deal with bibliographies and title pages, too, but not empy phrases ('it would seem that' etc) or number of words.
