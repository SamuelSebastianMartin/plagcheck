QUESTIONS

Am I missing some results due to the 'remove duplicates' function? 
For example, it they all start with the word 'a', then 'a big dog' should
replace 'a' and 'a big'. However, if 'a big' appears independently elsewhere
in the essay, it should not be removed. Check to see if this is occurring.
