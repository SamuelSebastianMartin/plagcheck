## Me learning Python

This program relates to my work, where students write an essay based on a series of academic texts given to them in a reading pack. 
The program looks for words or phrases in the essay which are taken directly from the reading pack.

In order to facilitate the running of python's 'unittest', I have also decided to build the project with few or no nested functions, but to use modules to group functions together. Detailed test can then be run on modules, and more general tests can be run on the main program.

## THIS VERSION

I'm starting from scratch, 4 years later. The aim is to minimalise the process, with fewer nested loops and less conversion between lists and strings. I hope the code will be much simpler, even if some aspects are not completely efficient.
